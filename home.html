			<h2>How it works:</h2>
			<p>Once you select a book and enter your email address, you will recieve a concise and easy-to-read email overview of the most important points from the book of your choice, one chapter at a time. For example, if a book has 30 chapters, you will recieve a daily email for 30 days in a row, one for each chapter. Once you have finished the book, the emails stop, giving you the option to choose another book if you'd like. If you decide that you don't like a particular book, you can opt out of the emails at any time!</p>
