# Morning-Chapter
Morning Chapter was a small email-list business I ran that sent tri-weekly emails that summarized chapters from renowned books on self-help, finance/investing, and science/technology.

To my knowledge, in order to run this website you will need npm and nodemon installed. The app is set to run on port 5000.

In the directory holding app.js, you may run "nodemon app.js" to start the app. The app is set to run on port 5000, so you may access it in your browser via the URL http://localhost:5000/.
