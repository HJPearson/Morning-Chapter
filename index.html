						<p style="display: inline;">It's a well known fact that the majority of career success comes from your ability to deal with people, not just from having technical know-how. That's why <i><b>How to Win Friends and Influence People</b></i> has sold millions of copies and become a staple for the world's most successful people. <br><br>Though this book was made popular as a way to succeed in business, its principles are just as applicable to your personal life. This<b style="color: #5A4AE3; display: inline; vertical-align: top;"> Morning Chapter </b>selection will teach you:
						<br><br><b>- 3 fundamentals of dealing with people<br>- 6 ways of making people like you<br>- 12 ways of winning people to your way of thinking<br>- 9 ways of changing people without offending them<br><br></b>A must read, it will give you the interpersonal skills needed to move up in your career, take on a leadership position, or maybe just make a friend or two.
						<br><br><b>Don't stress about subscribing in the middle of the book. We'll give you what you need to catch up, as well as post the book in its entirety once it's finished.</b></p>
						<hr>
						<b style="color:#5A4AE3;">Important:</b>
						<br>We, of course, want you to sign up for Morning Chapter, but we also support authors and understand the value of reading the actual book. We strive to give you the most important information from the book, but what seems important to us may not necessarily be what you think is important. Because of this, it's likely that there are other insights in this book that you would find impactful but we decided to leave out. This is why <b>our daily emails will never be an equal substitute for reading the book yourself</b>. 
						That being said, we will leave a link for you to <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People/Dale-Carnegie/9781982171452">buy the book</a>, as we highly recommend doing so.
